# Spotify Now Playing

A little react app that displays the current song you're playing in spotify.

## Running

1. Start `Snip`, then configure in the `Snip` tray icon "Save Information Separately" and "Album Artwork". Change the output format to just be the bare strings for the title and artist.

2. Start the next.js server by running `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, or add a `Browser` content source to obs to the same URL.
